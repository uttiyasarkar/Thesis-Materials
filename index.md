### Comments from Sanjay Swain

- P8: Why v is there ? Isn’t supposed to be normalized state of (phi_1 +/- phi_2) ?</p>
  Correct. It is a typo. Fixed
  
- P11. Table 2.1: How do you experimentally measure the charge of quarks ? For that matter even how to experimentally find our quark have spin=1/2 and has 3 colours ?
- P11. Table 2.2: Is there reason why range of weak interaction (10^-16) is smaller than the one mentioned below (which is for strong interaction ~ 10 ^-13 as shown by you) ?
- P12: What is meaning of unification ? The three couplings should be exactly same or they should be related or something else ? 
- P12: well, its not a new problem. The electron is lighter than protons and needed some explanation why ? It was raised by Dirac.
- P15. Eq. 3.1: This equation itself, does it solve hierarchy problem ?
- P16: replace “sfermions” by “as sfermions” ?
- P16: Where is the neutralino and charginos in the list ?
- P16: why it MUST be broken ?
- P17. Table 3.1:  think you should mention what each column represent in the below table ? For example what is S ?  Spin ? Always good to mentions the details of the table in caption.
- P17: “and s is the spin of a particle.” which particle ? SUSY or SM particles ?


### Comments from Bill Ford

1. Green: p. 8, next-to-last paragraph, last line: “when 𝜃=0”, or any other specific value?
2. p. 9, next-to-last sentence of 2.2.1: a “theorem” is not a “method”.
3. p. 10, sentence between Eqs. (2.12-2.13): “This clearly indicates”: may be help the reader a bit with something like “the field-independent coefficient of WW and (1/2)ZZ [I leave the super- and subscripts to be filled in] gives the squared mass of the W and Z boson, respectively”.
Table 2.2: Cite PDG or other sources for the numerical values.
4. p. 16: It might be useful to introduce the words “wino” and “bino” while you are at it: “gaugino mixtures of wino (W̃) and bino (B̃) are called …”. That better sets up Table 3.2, where we see that the photino and zino do not really show up in the MSSM.
5. p. 17, next-to-last sentence: I’d omit the “it is more interesting”, since that is in the eye of the beholder. Maybe “in this thesis we concentrate on”.
6. p. 52, line 6: I am not sure what is the reasoning for calling this version of T5ZZ a two-parameter scenario, when in the end you vary only one. I am not aware of any physics argument for the 50 GeV separation between gluino and NLSP masses that would prefer fixing that. It seems more of an experimental choice on the same footing as the chosen LSP mass.
7. p. 63, second bullet: You could explain the “additional criterion to minimize the reduction in signal efficiency” by noting that if 𝑝⃗Tmiss is aligned with the jet that is within a margin of the detector dead region, the resulting 𝑝⃗Tmiss may be the result of some of the jet’s energy having gone undetected.
8. Figs. 5.5, 5.9: From the order in which these figures are mentioned in the text, it looks as if either the figures or their labels are swapped.
9. p. 90, first sentence: This wording seems to be a circular definition of 𝜇!
